Since my research, most of my resources have been shared for free. I have opened 13 repositories and provided my private data and codes to many scholars in private. Recently, an unidentified user attempted to obtain my private data and codes by leaving issues offensively. I will never provide any resources for rude users. All scholars should communicate with each other with respect and courtesy.
